# Untitled project

[![Open in Mokxi](https://mokxi.com/badge/open-in-mokxi.svg)](https://mokxi.com/p/ehft5cE05l9xb7RU)

A circuit and its code, made in [Mokxi](https://mokxi.com), the electronics simulator that runs in your browser.

## What is in here

- `Untitled_project_mega25602/`: the sketch for `mega25602`, ready for the Arduino IDE (open `Untitled_project_mega25602/semaforo.h`).
- `Untitled_project_sketch/`: the sketch, ready for the Arduino IDE (open `Untitled_project_sketch/Untitled_project_sketch.ino`).
- `diagram.mokxi.json`: the whole Mokxi project (parts, wires and code). Mokxi opens it as it is.
- `.vscode/`: settings, tasks and the recommended extension for VS Code.

## Open it in Mokxi

Press the badge above, or in the Mokxi editor choose **Export > Open from GitHub** and pick this repository.

## Work on it in VS Code

1. Open this folder in VS Code. It suggests the **Mokxi** extension; install it.
2. Run **Mokxi: Sign In** from the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P, or Cmd+Shift+P on a Mac).
3. Edit the sketch, then run **Mokxi: Sync** to send it to Mokxi, or **Mokxi: Open in Mokxi** to see it run.

The tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json` (Terminal > Run Task) do the same from the terminal, and can compile with `arduino-cli` when you have it.

## From a terminal

```sh
npx @mokxi/cli login            # once
npx @mokxi/cli pull PROJECT_ID .  # get the latest from Mokxi (the id is in the project link)
npx @mokxi/cli push         # send your edits to Mokxi
npx @mokxi/cli run          # simulate it and print the serial output
```
